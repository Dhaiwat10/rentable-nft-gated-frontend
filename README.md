# Rentable NFT frontend

## Steps to make this work with your contract:

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into it

2. Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

3. Edit the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` variable in the `./pages/api/verify.ts` file to match your contract's address.

4. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server. You will see your app running in the browser.

5. Connect the wallet you rented an NFT to, enter the token ID and click 'Sign in and unlock.'
